My commit messages for Week 4 were not so informative. So I committed and pushed again to make the messages relate to the file content.
Everything in Week 5 is fine.
Week 6: The frequency table was not displayed in the health task. I added an input and a print of the relative risk matching the input age.
The scatter plot in the health task was not labled. I added an x-lable "Father Age" and a y-lable "Relative Risk".
The pseudocode of the health task was not well documented. I didn't understand the guidance well before. I changed some of the pseudocode to make it clearer.
In the mark task, I wrongly labled the y-lable as "mark". It is changed to x-lable now which is correct.
